# Prisma

Prisma is a storage data plane that accelerates the training performance of Deep Learning (DL) frameworks.
It implements a parallel data prefetching mechanism that reads training data in advance and stores it in an in-memory buffer to serve incoming I/O requests of DL frameworks.

The code for _"The Case for Storage Optimization Decoupling in Deep Learning Frameworks"_ will be published here soon.
